Zipped versions of all Krona outputs are available in the KaijuTriplicate folder. To access a plot simply choose the folder corresponding to the year you're interested in and choose one of the Krona files. There are three triplicates available for each of the layers (i.e. Top(T), Middle(M), Bottom(B)). After opening the Krona file of interest download it using the download button and open it from your downloads folder. It should unzip automatically during downloading allowing ease of access.

If there any issues please let me know.
